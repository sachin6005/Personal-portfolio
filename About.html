            <article>About me</article>
            <p>I was born in karnataka and raised in Hyderabad.</p>
            <p>I have done/completed my graduation in mechanical engineering from Mallareddy engineering college with 8.3 CGPA/ 83 %. </p>
            <p>During my time at college, I was involved in student unions where I hosted many events, one of such is women empowerment.
               So, I was really able to build strong skills in mentoring and collaborating with the team.</p>
            <p>I am comfortable with the world of tech as my goal is to acquire technical skills.
               So after my mechanical engineering degree, I joined a coding Bootcamp where I could be able to gain technical skills on frontend development. </p>
